On April 26th, I successfully defended my Ph.D dissertation, [*Advanced Algorithms and Applications in Machine Learning*](https://www.zhengqxhs.com/publication/thesis/).

The committee meeting was hosted virtually by my advisor, Dr. Martin Takac, along with other committee members, Dr. Frank E. Curtis, Dr. Soumyadip Ghosh, and Dr. Srinivas Rangarajan. After 5.5 years of the journey, I am now officially a ***Doctor in Philosophy***! 👨‍🎓 🧑‍🔬
